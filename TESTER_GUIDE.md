# Otantist — Early Tester Guide

Thank you for being an early tester of Otantist. This guide will help you get started and explain what the app can do. Please read it before your first login.

---

## What is Otantist?

Otantist is a private messaging app designed for autistic and neurodivergent people. It is built around comfort and safety — you control how and when you communicate.

This is an early beta. Some things may not be finished, and your feedback helps shape what gets built next.

---

## What you will need

- An **invite code** (provided by the person who invited you)
- An **email address** you can access (for verification)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

The app is available at: **https://otantist.com** _(link will be provided separately)_

---

## Creating your account

1. Go to the app and click **Register**
2. Enter your email address, choose a password, and enter your invite code
3. Check your email for a verification link and click it
4. Read and accept the terms of use
5. Complete your profile setup (5 short steps — you can save and come back if needed)

Once that is done, you will land on your main dashboard.

---

## Setting up your profile (onboarding)

The setup has 5 steps. None of them are required to be perfect — you can update everything later in Settings.

| Step          | What you do                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Profile       | Choose a display name and age group                             |
| Communication | Set your preferred tone and messaging style                     |
| Sensory       | Adjust animations and colour intensity                          |
| Availability  | Set the hours when you are available to receive messages        |
| Topics        | Add conversation starters, topics to avoid, and tips for others |

---

## Your main dashboard

After setup, you land on the **messaging dashboard**. It has two parts:

- **Left sidebar** — your list of conversations
- **Right panel** — the open conversation

At the top is the toolbar with your name, energy level, and quick links.

---

## Social energy

Social energy shows others how available you are right now. You set it yourself using the coloured circles in the toolbar:

- 🟢 **High** — happy to chat
- 🟡 **Medium** — available but not fully
- 🔴 **Low** — prefer not to be contacted right now

This is optional. You can change it at any time or leave it as-is. Other users can see your current energy level.

---

## Calm mode

Calm mode pauses all incoming messages so you are not interrupted. Messages sent to you while calm mode is on will be held and delivered when you turn it off.

- Turn it on or off with the **moon button** in the toolbar
- A **purple banner** appears at the top of the screen when calm mode is active
- Your conversation list will appear dimmed while calm mode is on

---

## Starting a conversation

1. Click **New conversation** in the left sidebar
2. Search for the person you want to talk to by name
3. Optionally write a first message
4. Click **Start conversation**

You can only message people who have finished setting up their profile.

---

## Inside a conversation

### How to talk to someone

Click the **info button** (ⓘ) next to the person's name at the top of the chat. This shows their communication preferences — their preferred tone, topics they enjoy, things to avoid, and tips they have shared.

### Message status

Each message shows a small indicator:

- **Queued** — waiting to be delivered (recipient has calm mode on or is outside their availability hours)
- **Sent** — successfully sent
- **Delivered** — received by their device
- **Read** — they have read it

### Deleting a message

Click **Delete** on any message to remove it from your view. The other person can still see it. This is intentional — it preserves the conversation for the other person.

### Hiding a conversation

Click **Hide conversation** to remove it from your sidebar. If the other person sends you a new message, it will automatically reappear.

---

## Settings

Click your **name** in the toolbar to open Settings. You can update any part of your profile from here:

- **Profile** — display name, age group, visibility
- **Communication** — tone, messaging modes, rhythm
- **Sensory** — animations, colour intensity
- **Availability** — your hours for each day of the week
- **Conversation starters** — good topics, topics to avoid, tips for others
- **Language** — French or English

Each section saves on its own. You do not need to fill everything in at once.

---

## Blocking and reporting

### Blocking

If someone makes you uncomfortable, you can block them. Open your conversation with them and click **Block user**. This will:

- Prevent them from sending you messages
- Archive your conversation with them

You can unblock someone at any time from the **blocked users list** in the toolbar.

### Reporting

To report a user or a specific message, click the **Report** button in the conversation. Reports go to the Otantist team for review. Your identity is not shared in the report.

---

## For parents

If your account is linked to a managed member, you will see a **Parent** button in the toolbar. This takes you to the parent dashboard where you can:

- See recent activity indicators for your member (last 30 days)
- View and acknowledge alerts

Your member's actual message content is private. Indicators show patterns only (for example, how long calm mode was active), not individual messages.

---

## Giving feedback

Your feedback is the most useful thing you can give at this stage. If something is confusing, broken, feels wrong, or is missing, please let us know.

There is no formal feedback form yet. Contact the person who invited you directly.

Things that are especially helpful to hear:

- Anything that felt confusing or unclear
- Anything that felt uncomfortable or overwhelming
- Features you wished existed
- Things that worked well and felt right

---

## A note on privacy

- Your messages are stored securely
- Your profile is only visible to other registered users
- You control your visibility in Settings
- The Otantist team may review flagged content for moderation purposes only
